# Keter-YG
Yoram Gnat's Keter-YG Hebrew typeface with minor typographical features added

## About This Project

This project is a fork of https://github.com/ibleaman/Keter-YG. As the changes made in this fork are motivated by a very specific use case, they are limited to the upright, medium-weight style of the font, and they concern vowel marks, but not cantillation marks. (If there is demand for it in the Issues for this code, I can make broader changes in the future, but for now, the cantillation placement of the original font will be left alone.) This fork differs from the original project in that it uses a more recent version (.103yg) of the Keter YG Medium font and incorporates the following changes:
- Improved positioning of vowel points, especially for yod, lamed, and qof.
- Improved positioning of holam.
- New substitution to merge holam (U+05B9) and shin dot (U+05C1) when a holam precedes a shin with the shin dot and merging of sin dot (U+05C2) and holam when a shin with the sin dot also has a holam.
