# Keter-YG
Yoram Gnat's Keter-YG Hebrew typeface with minor typographical features added

## About This Project

This project, a fork of https://github.com/ibleaman/Keter-YG, differs from the original project in that it uses a more recent version (.103yg) of the Keter YG Medium font, it only includes the upright, medium-weight style of the font, and it adds the following changes:
- Improved positioning of vowel points (anchor classes 4â€“7), especially for yod, lamed, and qof. 
- New substitution to merge holam (U+05B9) and shin dot (U+05C1) when a holam precedes a shin with the shin dot and merging of sin dot (U+05C2) and holam when a shin with the sin dot also has a holam.
